# About this project
I created this tribute page for my brother, who's a local singer/songwriter that goes by the handle **Free Ghost** on SoundCloud.

For this project, I utilized CSS Grid rather than a CSS framework. Design is not really my forte, so I opted to keep things simple with basic shades of gray.

One improvement I'd like to make would be to figure out a better solution for the header image, which I feel looks too big on a full desktop screen. Perhaps the solution would be to start with a smaller photo from the beginning.

I really tried to focus on a mobile-first design approach, utilizing only 1 media query for larger screens.

I welcome any and all constructive criticism and feedback, as I'd love to become a better web developer and designer.
